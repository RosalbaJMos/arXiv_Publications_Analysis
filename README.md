# arXiv_Publications_Analysis
## This is an App that analyzes the abstracts of the last articles published on arXiv in 2021

## Project Description
 Part 1:

    The First plot (shown on the point 1.0), shows the number of articles published per month on arXiv in 2021 that corresponds to the fields of Physics, Maths, Computer Science, and Biology

 Part 2: 
 
    The App shows the keywords that appear the most when dividing the relevant field (Physics, Biology, Math, or CS) into six main topics. The main words related to each topic are shown in each plot and also display as wordclouds.

Part 3:
    In this part, the user can introduce an abstract for classification as a abstract that falls into one of the following categories: 
                - Physics
                - Biology
                - Computer Science (CS)
